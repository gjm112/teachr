Modules for problem-based lesson plans with R

# Why use teachr?

I am developing teachr to faciliate the sharing of problem-oriented statistics curricula and lesson-plans. The vision is to have a standardized repository where teachrs can include 'modules'  that they have used to teach R in a classroom setting.

# What is a module?


# How do I use a module in my class?


# How can I contribute a module to teachr?


# What format does a module need to be in?
